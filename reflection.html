Getting comfortable with the grid layout of Bootstrap was my biggest hurdle in completing this assignment, particularly with the composer pages where nested columns, etc. were required to achieve the prescribed layout.

I watched several YouTube vidoes and reviewed written tutorials to achieve my goals. 

I finally feel like I became somewhat used to the syntax. I have some experience with creating websites in basic HTML and CSS, but just getting used to the framework is what took time. 

Overall, I would say that it has been a constructive and beneficial experience.
